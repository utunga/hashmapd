#NOTE2ED I'm thoroughly confused by python's package maanagement defaults
#         is this the 'standard' way to do this or am I missing things?
#        at the moment I'm working on the idea that into __init__.py its common to put imports
#       for all the bits we expect callees to want to have 'easy' access to and require import hashmapd.xyz for more internal 'xyz' bits ? - MKT 2010--01
